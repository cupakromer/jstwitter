JSTwitter
=========
This my work through of the [Jumpstart Labs](http://jumpstartlab.com/)
Ruby exericse [JSTwitter](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jstwitter.markdown).

A test Twitter account was used for this project and may not exist in
the future. Additionally, the `jumpstart_auth` gem is required to run this
app.


The first time this is run it'll use the `Launchy` gem to pop open your web
browser and ask for permission to use your account. We've setup several test
accounts with these credentials which will be distributed in class.

Twitter will then give you a pin number that's about 10 digits. Copy it to your
clipboard, go over to your IRB session, and paste it in where the prompt says
`Enter the supplied pin:`.

This will create a settings.yml file with this information saved.
